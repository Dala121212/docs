This page describes some of the features and benefits of TypeScript. If you are already familiar with TypeScript, you can continue to [Adding a new component](../adding-a-new-component/).


### TypeScript Benefits

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and supports the latest JavaScript features.

- TypeScript is an Object Oriented Programming language which possesses all the features and concepts that help to write cleaner and more robust code.

- Typescript supports static type checking, which means that errors can be found at compile time rather than run time.

- Typescript reduces confusion. When multiple developers are writing large scale applications and working on the same project, dealing with dynamic variables can become complex. The static type checking features of TypeScript can help to reduce this complexity.

- TypeScript code can be compiled down to ES5 and ES6 standards thus giving support for the latest features to older browsers.

These are some key TypeScript concepts that can help you understand how to use it effectively when creating Enact components or Apps.
